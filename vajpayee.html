<h1 style="color:black;font-size:75px;">Vajpayee was born into a Hindu Kanyakubja Brahmin family[2] on 25 December 1924 in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh.[3] His mother was Krishna Devi and his father was Krishna Bihari Vajpayee.[4] His father was a school teacher in their home town.[5] His grandfather, Shyam Lal Vajpayee, had migrated to Morena near Gwalior from his ancestral village of Bateshwar in the Agra district of Uttar Pradesh.[4]

Vajpayee did his schooling at the Saraswati Shishu Mandir in Gwalior. In 1934, he was admitted to the Anglo-Vernacular Middle (AVM) School in Barnagar, Ujjain district, after his father joined as headmaster. He subsequently attended Gwalior's Victoria College, Agra University (now Maharani Laxmi Bai Govt. College of Excellence) where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Hindi, English and Sanskrit. He completed his post-graduation with a Master of Arts in political science from DAV College, Kanpur, Agra University.[3][6]</h1>


<h1 style="color:red;font-size:130px;font-style:italic;">Early Political Career (1947–1975)</h1>


<h1 style="color:black;font-size:75px;">In 1951, Vajpayee was seconded by the RSS, along with Deendayal Upadhyaya, to work for the newly formed Bharatiya Jana Sangh, a Hindu right-wing political party associated with the RSS. He was appointed as a national secretary of the party in charge of the Northern region, based in Delhi. He soon became a follower and aide of party leader Syama Prasad Mukherjee. In the 1957 Indian general election, Vajpayee contested elections to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament. He lost to Raja Mahendra Pratap in Mathura, but was elected from Balrampur. In the Lok Sabha his oratorial skills so impressed Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that he predicted that Vajpayee would someday become the prime minister of India.[10][11][12]

Vajpayee's oratorial skills won him the reputation of being the most eloquent defender of the Jana Sangh's policies.[13] After the death of Deendayal Upadhyaya, the leadership of the Jana Sangh passed to Vajpayee.[14] He became the national president of the Jana Sangh in 1968,[15] running the party along with Nanaji Deshmukh, Balraj Madhok, and L. K. Advani.[14]<br>

Vajpayee was arrested along with several other opposition leaders during the Internal Emergency imposed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.[5][16] Initially interned in Bangalore, Vajpayee appealed his imprisonment on the grounds of bad health, and was moved to a hospital in Delhi.[17] In December 1976, Vajpayee ordered the student activists of the ABVP to tender an unconditional apology to Indira Gandhi for perpetrating violence and disorder.[18][19] The ABVP student leaders refused to obey his order.[18][20]

Gandhi ended the state of emergency in 1977. A coalition of parties, including the BJS, came together to form the Janata Party, which won the 1977 general elections.[21] Morarji Desai, the chosen leader of the alliance, became the prime minister. Vajpayee served as the minister of external affairs, or foreign minister, in Desai's cabinet.[22] As foreign minister, Vajpayee became the first person in 1977 to deliver a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in Hindi.[22]

In 1979, Desai and Vajpayee resigned, triggering the collapse of the Janata Party.[17][23] The erstwhile members of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh came together to form the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1980, with Vajpayee as its first President.[24]

Leading up to Operation Bluestar, there were several protests by Sangh Parivar, includie nuclear tests were popular domestically. In effect, the international sanctions imposed failed to sway India from weapon

AIADMK's withdrawal from coalition
The AIADMK had continually threatened to withdraw from the coalition and national leaders repeatedly flew down from Delhi to Chennai to pacify the AIADMK general secretary J. Jayalalithaa. However, in May 1999, the AIADMK did pull the plug on the NDA, and the Vajpayee administration was reduced to a caretaker status pending fresh elections scheduled for October 1999.[56]<br>
